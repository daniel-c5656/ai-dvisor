The courses you take per semester are what dominate the way you spend your time at university, which is why working with an academic advisor is so important. However, academic advisors often have a lot of people to cover and may not be able to answer some of the questions you need very quickly. AI-dvisor is an LLM-powered university course advisor that allows you to build a course plan from scratch and gives you the immediate, much-needed answers about said plan as you build it. It also allows you to explore some of the course options you have to complete your major.

*"But can't I just ask ChatGPT or some other LLM/chatbot for course advice directly?"*

You absolutely could. However, those LLMs only have knowledge on the previous semesters they may have been trained on. But you want to know what to take *next semester*, which an off-the-shelf LLM would likely not be aware of. Asking it a question would only leave you with outdated information that just ends up wasting your time. On the other hand, AI-dvisor always has the most up-to-date course information possible, including times, professors, and available slots. The plans you make in AI-dvisor are also plans you can assemble in Web Registration.

3. You will be brought to the plan page. To the left, you'll see a week calendar similar to Web Registration. To the right, there is a chat interface. That is your AI-dvisor.

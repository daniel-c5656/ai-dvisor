# Objectives

The objective of AI-dvisor is to make the process of creating course plans easier and more personalized for students. These course plans should be able to balance the student's desired workload and interests while still accounting for the very concrete problems of fulfiling degree objectives in a timely manner.

To do this, AI-dvisor will use specialized AI agents with access to key information such as courses offered, the student's major, year, and overall degree progress. With this information, the AI must be able to recommend a relevant course plan that the student can ideally register for as-is, or at least with minimal adjustment.

AI-dvisor is not a replacement for a student's assigned school advisor and will not claim to be. It is meant as an easy-to-use tool to navigate the complexity of course selection that can be used at any time.
